We have detected that your instance is running an unauthorised Tor exit node.
While we can allow some forms of Tor exit nodes on the network, they need to be
authorised with our support staff ahead of time.

To protect our network from potential abuse, we have suspended your instance.
To unsuspend your service, you must open a ticket requesting unsuspension and immediately
remove the unauthorised exit node.

We do allow Tor exit nodes on our network which are configured in a way that
removes any potential for abuse.

Specifically, configuring the exit policy to deny access to the following ports
will allow us to whitelist your Tor exit node:

- 25
- 194
- 465
- 587
- 994
- 6657
- 6660 through 6670
- 6697
- 7000 through 7005
- 7070
- 8000 through 8004
- 9000
- 9001
- 9998
- 9999

Thank you for your attention to this matter.{% endblock %}
