Despite our multiple attempts to contact you about this service's expiration,
you have not renewed this service.

Thusly, in a few minutes, this service will be suspended.

If your service is not renewed by the end of the day on {{ delete_ts | strftime('%m/%d/%Y') }},
the service will be deleted and all data associated with it will be irrecoverably
destroyed.

To renew your service:

1. Connect to the management portal at https://manage.tortois.es/
2. Select the service.
3. Click "Renew" on the service dashboard.
4. Pay the resulting invoice.

If you do not want your service anymore:

1. Connect to the management portal at https://manage.tortois.es/
2. Select the service.
3. Click "Delete" on the service dashboard.
4. Confirm that you wish to delete the service.

Unfortunately, as your service has now been suspended, we cannot allow you to make a
payment arrangement to restore the service.  A payment to renew the service will
immediately restore the service.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.{% endblock %}
